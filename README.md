### Rules
The rules are as follows:  
Just like in regular tic tac toe, the two players (X and O) take turns, starting with X. The game starts with X playing wherever they want in any of the 81 empty spots. Next, the opponent plays, however they are forced to play in the small board corresponding to the location of the previous move, relative to the small board in which it was played. For example, if X plays in the top right square of a small (3 ï¿½ 3) board, then O has to play in the small board located at the top right of the larger board. Playing any of the available spots decides which small board the next player will play in.  
If a move is played so that it wins a small board by the rules of normal tic tac toe, then the entire small board is marked as won by the player in the larger board. Once a small board is won by a player or it is filled completely, no more moves may be played in that board. If a player is sent to such a board, then that player may play in any other board. Game play ends when either a player wins the larger board or there are no legal moves remaining, in which case the game is a draw.
